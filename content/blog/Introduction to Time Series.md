## Examples of Time Series

A **time series** is a set of observations $x_t$, at a specific time t. Most examples of time series in the digital format are of the discrete type. Any digital or physical recording of a continuous analog signal can only be performed by sampling and, is hence rendered discrete. So I guess for all practical purposes, we would be mostly dealing with discrete time series.
