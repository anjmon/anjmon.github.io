## Hello, I'm Anjan

I'm a **Data Scientist** with a bend towards **Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**. 
I mostly work with Python and getting better at the language everyday. I have been practicing problems on LeetCode (probably not as much as I should)
and sometimes pick up *Learning Python* by **Mark Lutz** to deepen my knowledge of Python.
Currently, I am also reading *Time Series Analysis and Forecasting* by **Brockwell, P. J., & Davis, R. A.**
